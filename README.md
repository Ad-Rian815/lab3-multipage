## Project Description  
This project is a multi-page responsive website designed to demonstrate CSS3 styling techniques, including Flexbox, Grid, media queries, and animations. The project consists of three pages:  

### Pages & Features  

#### 1️ **Home Page (index.html)**  
- Uses **Flexbox** to display content in two sections (e.g., hero banner and sidebar).  
- Includes a **navigation bar** shared across all pages.  

#### 2️ **Services Page (services.html)**  
- Uses **CSS Grid** to display **four service cards**.  
- Each service card contains an **image, title, and description**.  
- Features **padding, borders, and hover effects** for interactivity.  

#### 3️ **Contact Page (contact.html)**  
- Contains a **styled HTML5 contact form** (name, email, subject, and message).  
- Uses **CSS to align form fields responsively**.  
- Implements **HTML5 validation** and **subtle animations** (button hover effect).  

##  Summary of Features Used  

###  CSS Selectors  
- Element selectors (`h1`, `p`, `img`)  
- Class selectors (`.service-card`, `.grid-container`)  
- Pseudo-classes (`:hover`, `:focus`)  

###  Layout Techniques  
- **Flexbox** (for navbar and homepage layout)  
- **Grid** (for service cards on `services.html`)  

###  Responsive Design  
- **Media queries** for breakpoints at:  
  - `max-width: 1024px`  
  - `max-width: 768px`  
  - `max-width: 480px`  

###  Animations & Transitions  
- **Hover effects** on service cards (`transform: scale(1.05)`, `box-shadow`).  
- **Button transitions** on the contact form.
